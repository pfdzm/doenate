## Background and story

Help a Berliner, Dönate a Döner!

Dönate is a proof of concept app that makes it as easy as possible for people to donate to charitable causes in Berlin. The app offers the choice of a one-time-payment or a recurring monthly subscription of € 3.50 (standard price of a [Döner Kebab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doner_kebab) in Berlin).

Please check out the project presentation here for a bit of background info: [Google Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L4QeRol8mwA7bssrSy-YJW0hZB36BJs7xyTWdbbQx0Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## Deployment

Check out the live app [here!](https://doner.now.sh/).

## Tech stack

Dönate was built with React using Create-React-App. All components were 'hand-built' using TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, using PostCSS to remove unused classes and bring down the bundle size. A big focus during the project was performance and ease of use.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
